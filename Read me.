Implementation of Rigorous Two-Phase Locking (Wait -die).

Name: AMEY JAYANT PURANIK


In this project, we have implemented rigorous Two phase locking with wait and die as a deadlock prevention technique. We have implemented this algorithm in Java SE 8 as base programming language and Eclipse neon 2 as integrated development environment.

The project is attached in the zip file with the name two_phase_locking.zip. We have submitted the pseudo code for this project and referring that code we have implemented the algorithm.

Guidelines to execute the project.

•	To run this project successfully we need to have eclipse neon 2 version installed in the system.
•	Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
•	Version: Neon.2 Release (4.6.2)
•	Then, we need to import the zip file with the name two_phase_locking.zip in the eclipse IDE.
•	Click on file on the top right corner of the IDE.
•	Select Import.
•	And, import the two_phase_locking.zip in the IDE.
•	Before compiling and running the project, we need to follow the below note.


Important Note: - 
******************************************************************************
(Before compiling these project, we need to create the folder with the name root in the E:\ directory of the system. And we need to store the input files in this folder. I have attached the root folder in my zip file. We can just copy this root folder in the E:\root directory of the system. 

The input should be saved in the text file in the above given path. We have attached the root folder with all the input transactions in separate text file. Root folder is attached with the zip file. 

(Path is being hardcoded in the code)

•	After the root folder is created we need to click on the run command in the IDE.
•	We will see the following message.
•	The program is running successfully. Now, please enter the input file name in (filename.txt, example: inputread.txt) format. 

•	Then, we need to write the input file name saved in the (E:\root ) folder  on the command line.

•	Then hit enter.

•	The code will read the text input file and execute the two-phase Locking protocol.

The entire code is self-developed however I have taken some reference from the following links to have clarification on certain topics.
